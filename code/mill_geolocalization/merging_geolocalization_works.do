/*
This script merges together the spreadsheets used for manual geolocalization 
(through triangular matching between IBS, Manufacturing directories (MD) and UML.) 
Then, it makes and documents additional manual modifications to the data, in order to resolve conflicts (mill name or coordinates duplicates).

It needs: 
* input: temp_data/processed_IBS/IBS_PO_98_15_cleaned.dta
*		 input_data/manually_matched_ibs_uml/mills_to_georeference_post2010_done.xls 	 sheet("mills to georef")
*  	     input_data/manually_matched_ibs_uml/mills_to_georeference_pre2011_done.xlsx	 sheet("Mills to georef")
*  	     input_data/manually_matched_ibs_uml/noto_done.xls 	sheet("Sheet1")
*  		 input_data/uml/traseMills_capEstyear.xlsx 	sheet("traseMills_capEstyear")
*		 input_data/manually_matched_ibs_uml/matching_unref/md_millMatching_modified.xlsx
* 		 input_data/manually_matched_ibs_uml/overall_btw_conflicts_done.xlsx


For this purpose, the first step is to prepare (in a .dta harmonized format) all 
the Excel spreadsheets containing the outputs of the manual works. 

	- oto is already in .dta from R file, it was not processed in an excel format. 
	- for noto, pre2011 and post2010 we want to check for each subset that there is only one mill_name and one coordinate value within firm_id
		(Duplicated mill_name and coordinate value across firm_id will be checked later, once they are all together.)
	- unref is in Excel cross-sectional format, with matched trase_code (named mill_id originally) and without coordinates, so this is to be fixed.

The case of 36342 and 67075 with Letawa, PT. 
36342 has observations from 1998 to 2009, and all duplicates from 2006 on. It matches directories in 2003 and 2006. 
In these years, there are only one Letawa in directories. 
Then, in 2009 and 2010, there are 2 Letawa in directories, in the same desa, with different numbers of workers that match 
36342 and 67075 respectively. 
Then, there is only one Letawa again, that matches 67075 now. 
Therefore, it seems likely that it has been the same mill from the beginning, but with some change in firm_id. 
The overlapping years of firm_id are 2006-2009. 
For 36342, these are duplicates of 2006. 
For 67075, the quantity is misreported (>100k tons of CPO.)
Therefore, we believe the most credible observation of Letawa is 36342 until 2006 included, and 67075 afterwards

* One last cleaning action: a mill geolocalized in Papua has island_name in Maluku, it is 46510
replace island_name = "Papua" if firm_id == 46510
replace island_factor = 5 if island_factor == 4

* I further checked that no firm has missing island_name while it has more precise (province, district, village) info) 


*** Distinguish geolocalized IBS mills, mills, and the rest. 
* at this stage, only mills matched with UML have coordinates
gen uml_matched_sample = (!mi(lat))

sort firm_id year
global mill_commo out_ton_cpo out_val_cpo out_ton_pko out_val_pko in_ton_ffb in_val_ffb
foreach var of varlist $mill_commo{
	bys firm_id: egen sum_`var' = sum(`var')
}

* The criterion to be a mill is to have at least one record of producing CPO or PKO, either in quantity or in value AND one record of sourcing FFB. 
* The AND condition removes 184 establishments from the is_mill sample with respect to the OR condition (producing either cpo or pko OR sourcing ffb)
* In the subsample of 470 mills matched with UML, the difference between the AND and the OR conditions is only 11 mills 
* (indicating that in IBS, almost all establishments credibly recognized as mills declare some FFB sourcing) 
* However, we are not interested only in mills declaring buying FFB. We also want to look at potentially integrated plantation-mill systems
* in which FFB is not traded, and the only output is CPO. 
* Therefore, we use the OR condition. 

gen is_mill = (((sum_out_ton_cpo >0 & !mi(sum_out_ton_cpo)) | ///
			    (sum_out_val_cpo >0 & !mi(sum_out_val_cpo)) | ///

			   ((sum_in_ton_ffb >0 & !mi(sum_in_ton_ffb)) | ///
			    (sum_in_val_ffb >0 & !mi(sum_in_val_ffb)))) 
* also, do not count mills that satisfy the above conditions but are in Java or Bali; 
replace is_mill = 0 if island_name == "Java" | island_name == "Bali Nusa Tenggara" 

* Of the 470 geolocalized mills, 2 have only missing info, 7 have missing FFB info, and 2 are in Java. 

* Now, add the village centroid coordinates.

merge m:1 firm_id using "temp_data/processed_mill_geolocalization/IBSmills_desacentro.dta", generate(merge_desa_centro) update
* nonmissing conflicts are those that have true coordinates 
* missing updated are those that have not been geo-localized through UML matching, and are now approximately geo-localized with their village centroids
* not matched from using come from the fact that some firm_id have been removed above in this script. We do not want to reintroduce them
drop if merge_desa_centro == 2

* round these new coordinates too
replace lat = round(lat, 0.001) if merge_desa_centro == 4
replace lon = round(lon, 0.001) if merge_desa_centro == 4

gen geo_sample = (!mi(lat))

gen analysis_sample = (geo_sample == 1 & is_mill == 1)

*codebook firm_id if analysis_sample == 1
* Now 587 establishments are identified as palm oil mills and are geo-localized. 466 precisely through matching with UML, and 121 with their valid, most recent, village centroids
