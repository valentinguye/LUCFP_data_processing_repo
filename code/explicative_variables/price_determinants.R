### PACKAGES ###
# see this project's README for a better understanding of how packages are handled in this project. 

# These are the packages needed in this particular script. 
neededPackages = c("plyr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "httr", "stringr", "haven",
                   "rgdal", "sf", "raster","sp",
                   "lubridate")

# Install them in their project-specific versions
renv::restore(packages = neededPackages)

not_installed_by_renv <- c("exactextractr", "DataCombine")
install.packages(not_installed_by_renv)
install.packages("exactextractr")

# Load them 
lapply(neededPackages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# /!\/!\ IF renv::restore(neededPackages) FAILS TO INSTALL SOME PACKAGES /!\/!\ 

# For instance sf could cause trouble https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/921 
# or magick, as a dependency of raster and rgdal. 

# FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
# 1. Remove these package names from neededPackages above, and rerun renv::restore(packages = neededPackages)
# 2. Write them in troublePackages below, uncomment, and run the following code chunk: 

# # /!\ THIS BREAKS THE PROJECT REPRODUCIBILITY GUARANTY /!\
# troublePackages <- c("exactextractr")
# # Attempt to load packages from user's default libraries.
# lapply(troublePackages, library, lib.loc = default_libraries, character.only = TRUE)

# 3. If the troubling packages could not be loaded ("there is no package called ...) 
#   you should try to install them, preferably in their versions stated in the renv.lock file. 
#   see in particular https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html
