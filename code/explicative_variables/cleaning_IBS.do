Over all the process, imp1 variables are associated with stronger imputations than imp2. 
It is to say that imp1 sample will be more modified than imp2, in an attempt to reduce noise.

/* 

The main idea behind removing qty and val extreme values and not merely extreme prices is that, for some reason, there are impossibly high qty and val, and we don't want to risk 
their ratio is deemed a normal price and these obs. used in the analyses. 

First, let us define otls. 
Statistically, they are those obs for which var > (p75+1.5iqr). And to be more precise we want to apply this definition within yearly cross-sections. 
Let us restrict this definition: otls are the obs that are statistical otls AND fail at least one test of likelihood. 
These tests use output/input ratio and CPO/PKO ratio and the variation_rate over time.
In other words, we will keep statistical otls that are however coherent with ALL the information we have. 
We don't extand the definition of otls (i.e. deem as otls obs. that are not statistical otls but are however not coherent with some of the information we have)
because this would require us to have high quality information on these other variables used (inputs and pko), which is not the case. This means 
that we don't see cases of extremely high say output/input ratio with normal output quantity as a hint of flawed measurement of output. We assume this is purely due to
input mismeasurement, and never because of a combination of mismeasurement of both. 

Regarding low otls, i.e. <(p25 - 1.5iqr). In theory, they should also be a concern. 
	...but there is none (for out_ton_cpo and out_val_cpo). For the ratios in the tests, we are not interested in spotting low otls because, since there are 
	only high otls for the variables of interest, they would only spot abnormally high secondary information (input, pko or previous). 

Regarding the test on variation_rate.  
 	Why is it ok to add it for cpo and pko qty and not for value nor for rpo and rpko qty? 
 	Because as such, this test is not very precise (and designing more sophisticated one would be time consuming and not necessarily worth it).
 	For out_ton_, including it makes an additional condition to the loosing of the otl definition, i.e. adding this test makes always less obs. "saved" from being statistical otls. 
 	On the other hand, adding it when it is the only test, in the out_val_ cases, means that adding this test makes always more obs. "saved", since otherwise you only use statistical 
 	otl definition. 

Regarding obs. that are value otl but not qty otl. 
	They have been deemed credible obs. with big quantities produced. So we keep them even if values are otl. If it appears that values are really too high, then the cleaning on 
	prices outliers will remove them. 


INFINE, 4 cases: 
	- Neither out_ton_cpo nor out_val_cpo are otls --> the obs. is kept. 
	- out_ton_cpo is an otl (it is a statistical otl and it failed one of tests 1,2,3) and out_val_cpo is not an otl --> obs is droped
	- out_ton_cpo is not an otl but out_val_cpo is --> obs is KEPT. 
	- out_ton_cpo and out_val_cpo are otls --> obs is droped. 


Some notes on the codes below. 
	- tabstat is not conditioned because we remove zeros (see just below) and missings don't impact the distribution calculation. 

	- Taking the `var'<. in the if and not in the () enables to interpret otl_`var'=0 as "the obs. is not an otl", and not as
	"the obs. is not an otl OR it is missing on out_ton_cpo". Recall, this "if" ensures that missings are not counted as otls.

Beside, we will only modify _imp1 and _imp2, and the procedures need to be done separately for each, because they don't have the same distributions
and hence not the same otl thresholds etc. 


In order for the 0 cells not to be accounted as such in the tabstats. This is justified by the fact that we won't be able to interpret and hence to use a price coming from a firm 
with 0 in one of these cells.

We should be be careful that when additional information is missing (there is no input data, or pko data, or it is the first observed year for this mill) 
the obs. is neither automatically discarded or kept: the statistical definition of otl should decide alone. 
generate otl_cpo = (otl_out_ton_cpo==1 & (otl_oir==1 | otl_cpopko_ratio==1 | otl_dt_out_ton_cpo==1))
for instance, this synthax is not good because statistical otls that happen to have no information on input, pko and t-1 out_ton_cpo fill non of the conditions in the second parentheses
thus they would be kept while we want the statistical otl definition to rule them out in this case.

Within year otl & with deflation	337					369					388					452				406					534					406					534
Within year otl & w/o deflation 	all the same
Across year otl & with deflation	329					392					384					478				426					565					426					565
Across year otl & w/o deflation 	329					392					384					478				357					517					357					517

What's to take away: 
Many qty outliers are duplicates on qty (likely within firm_id, since this is where most duplicates where) that kept only in imp2. 
Second line being the same as first line is logic: deflation does not change qty, nor does it change the identification of outliers for values if this is made within year anyway. 
If one defines outliers across the whole panel, more values are identified as being outliers after being deflated. 
Defining outliers across the whole panel rather than within each year does not lead to a very different number of obs. being removed. 

With the new code that keeps values outliers if they are not qty outliers, the first row (within year & with deflation) is 186 279 217 344. 
Hence many obs. are kept this way. 

*For RPO AND RPKO 
For now the only purpose is saying how much cpo weighs in one unit's production. 
We areconcerned that variance can be very strong for these variables because we can have both big refineries and many small mills doing only a bit of rpo. 
Hence we remove first very strong outliers. They produce more than 15 million ton in one year, which is not so credible.

/* 
There are many otls in the price. We attribute them to extremely low quantities which we have not treated as outliers supra. 
Indeed it is difficult to say until which minimum production of a commodity a mill can go, it can credibly produce very little sometimes. 
For imputation, we couldn't use input or byproducts because the mismeasurement can as well be rather there. 
So by removing price upper outliers we remove obs. that have either mismeasurement of quantity (too low) relative to value, or mismeasurement of value (too high though not outlier) relative to 
a true small quantity. 
And by removing price lower outlier we remove obs. that have either mismeasurement of value (too low) relative to quantity, or mismeasurement of quantity (too high though not outlier) relative to 
a true small value. 

For these two processes, is there a reason to spot outliers within years? To me no, because extreme values are only deemed as such with respect to a contemporaneous information.

***** VARIABLE DESIGNATIONS *****

/*
There are several variables at our disposition that relate with export. They contain different types of information, and their availability varies across years.
The support excel file summarizes their annual availability.
Based on that, we keep only one dummy variable and one total share variable. 

In what follows, export_dummy and export_dummy_imp refer to whether a firm exports or not, EKSPOR is the equivalent in Rothenberg.
export_pct, export_pct_imp or total/average/mean export share refer to the firm-level averaged percentage of all its products exported. 
_imp variables differ in that full duplicates in the main IBS dataset are removed from the former. Let us keep these duplicates for now (i.e. don't use _imp)
PRPREX is the same but from Rothenberg dataset.
prex refers to commodity specific export shares. 


EXPORT DUMMY
There is no information in export_dummy that there is not in EKSPOR. 
Moreover, we would rather keep all possible information and hence not remove within firm duplicates of export_dummy (i.e. we don't need _imp either)	
*/	
drop export_dummy export_dummy_imp
* EKSPOR is either 1 if there was some export, or 2 if there was NO export. 
replace EKSPOR = . if EKSPOR == 0 
replace EKSPOR = 0 if EKSPOR == 2

/*
EXPORT SHARE
The export_pct is the same as the PRPREX from 1998 to 2009 (with one exception of 1 missing in 2006 for PRPREX, that is a 0 in export_pct)
Then, in 2010-2012, all missings in PRPREX are counted as zeros in export_pct. 
Then in 2013-2015, all PRPREX are missing, and not export_pct. 
Hence, we can keep using only export_pct, with zeros being backed by EKSPOR.
Code to see it:
gen pos_PRPREX =(PRPREX >0 & !mi(PRPREX)) if !mi(PRPREX)
gen pos_export_pct =(export_pct >0 & !mi(export_pct)) if !mi(export_pct)
gen pos_prex_cpo =(prex_cpo >0 & !mi(prex_cpo)) if !mi(prex_cpo)
gen pos_prex_pko =(prex_pko >0 & !mi(prex_pko)) if !mi(prex_pko)
tabulate year pos_PRPREX , missing
tabulate year pos_export_pct , missing 
tabulate year pos_prex_cpo, missing 
tabulate year pos_prex_pko, missing

COMMODITY EXPORT SHARES 
imp1 and imp2 are not related to qty and value imp1 and imp2 above. But the same logic applies: imp1 is subject to stronger imputations than imp2, i.e. imp1_prex_vars take value on 
a more modified sample. 
The rationale is: imp1 makes strong imputations in the aim to get as many informative observations as possible. 
imp2 makes imputations in the aim to get straightforward available information. 
no imp is the least imputed version, necessary to see how raw data look like.

**** IMPUTATIONS ****

/*
MAIN PROBLEMS:
	
	ZEROS: The problem is raised empirically and theoretically. 
			Theoretically, there are two cases one can think of: 
			* It is likely that some actual exporters report null export shares for they really believe their outputs are not exported 
			because they sell them to domestic actors and have no downstream visibility. (Eventhough the questionaire asks "by own or others") 
			* or that those same firms, because of this uncertainty, leave a blank which might be in turn assigned a zero throughout the data collection and processing. 
				those latter zeros are called * SPURIOUS ZEROS * in what follows. 
			Empirically: 
			The number of zeros in all variables in all (available) years is striking at a first glance. 
			The annual effective (i.e. weighted by output) export shares are much below official national aggregates. 

	MISSINGS: Two distinct causes. 
			First, some variables have just not been delivered at all some years:
				EKSPOR: all obs. missing in 1998, 2013-2015
		        export_pct: all obs. missing in 2001-2003, 2005, 2007
		        prex: all obs. missing in 2006 and many missing in 2013-2015 
		    Second, for the remaining years, each variable still has missings. The reason for those may be numerous. One possible explanation is that some firms 
		    just did not answer those export questions because they did not know whether or to what extent their outputs were exported. 

TIME VARYING MISMEASUREMENT. 
		/*\ These causes being distinct is important, because it means that missing observations should not be looked at identically, depending on the variable and the year. \*/
			Therefore, the imputation process should account for the nature of the missing observation. 
			I.e. the imputations need to be conditionnal on available variables, and not homogeneously on both the dummy and the total share.   
			In particular, the years 2013-2015 heavily rely on imputations because they have very few non missing prex observations. They also have no available dummy. 
			Thus, conditionning on the dummy would result in heavily misleading imputations for these years. 
			 


MAIN RATIONALES HELPING TO HANDLE THESE PROBLEMS.
The availability of three different types of variables (dummy, total share and commodity share) makes it possible to identify some misreportings and impute some other values. 
The main rationales are (broadly here, more in details within the code below): 
Positive export shares are more credible information than the dummy, as they require an active reporting effort while the latter may be subject to 
ticking box mistakes. 
The dummy may adress the problem of missings, because it can clame for no export activity at all. It is easy to imagine that a firm that knows it does not 
export any of its output may report that in the dummy (which comes first in the questionaires) and then just leave blanks in the following questions on shares. 
The dummy may also help confirming that null export shares are actual believes of the respondents that their outputs weren't exported, rather than spurious zeros.


SUMMARIZED IMPUTATION PROCESS:

*** Turn missing export shares to zeros.
	- export_pct_imp: when the dummy is null.
	- imp1: if at least one of the dummy or the total export share is null, and the other one does not contradict.
	- imp2: idem, but in years when both variables are available, both must report null export.  

*** Turn null export shares to missing
	- export_pct_imp: when the dummy is positive.
	- imp1: when the dummy discredits it, or the total export share discredits it, or both are missing. 
	- imp2: never. 

*** Turn missing or null commodity export shares to positive. 

  ** = 100% for all commodities' imp1 and imp2: when the total export share is 100%.

  ** For CPO
	- imp1 and imp2 = export_pct_imp if CPO is the only commodity produced.
	- imp1 and imp2 = (total export - other commo export)/CPO output when only one other commodity is produced and it has a known export share. 
	- imp1 only = export_pct_imp in remaining cases, i.e. when imp1 is still missing because other commodities are produced but their export shares are unknown. 

  ** For PKO
  	idem. 

  ** Regarding RPO and RPKO, these are firms that are more likely to export other products that are not under our radar, because they are bigger factories and because there are many different
	 processed palm oil products. 
	 So the imputation is likely to be even less robust, so we don't do it at all. 

*** FILL GAPS 
	- imp1 = average of previous and next year when missing.
	- imp2 is not changed. 

****************************************************

One of the reasons behind the remaining spread between our averages and national ones (collected at traders in harbours directly) is respondents underestimating their 
export shares because they just don't know for some part of their productions. 

*/


*** TURN MISSINGS TO ZEROS
/*
It is pretty straightforward to impute that if a firm reports to have no export activity at all, then its total and commodity export shares are null. Also, it is flexible regarding which 
variable is available and hence minimizes the dependency to variables'availability.
However, imp2 is more conservative and requires more evidence of null export,  This limits the risk of a spurious zero at the level of total export share to change a missing into a 
new spurious zero at the commodity level.
Note that this implies that imp2 makes no such imputations in years where either the dummy or the total share is missing. Therefore the imputations are more dependent on 
variables' availability. 
Knowing that in 2013-2015 in particular there is almost no null commodity export shares, this choice will result in an underestimated number of null prex in these years. 
*/

replace export_pct_imp = 0 if mi(export_pct_imp) & EKSPOR == 0 
* (condition on export_pct_imp rather export_pct because we prefer to trust EKSPOR where export_pct was > 100 or negative, and EKSPOR is null)


foreach var of varlist $prex_vars{
	replace `var'_imp1 = 0 if mi(`var') & ((EKSPOR == 0 & (export_pct == 0 | mi(export_pct))) | (mi(EKSPOR) & export_pct == 0))
	replace `var'_imp2 = 0 if mi(`var') & (EKSPOR == 0 & export_pct == 0) | ///

}
* (This excludes the case where both variables are missing, in which case we have no reason to think that prex is zero rather than missing.) 

* for CPO this turns 3353 missing obs. to ZERO in imp1 and 3013 in imp2, THIS IS IMPORTANT. 


*** TURN ZEROS TO MISSINGS
/* 
When the dummy indicates export activity, but the total export share is reported a zero, there might be two scenarii: 
- either the dummy reflects reality, and the export share is a spurious zero
- or the export share reflects reality and the dummy has been mistakenly ticked. 
We choose to trust more in the former scenario, i.e. that mistakenly ticking a box is less likely than spurious zero cases.
We also remove null total shares that are not credible in light of positive commodity shares. 
The consequence of that is that those 120 likely spurious zeros won't be available for later imputation on commodity export shares based on total.

* we could impute total export shares from commodity export shares in different cases, but as the total export share is not planned to be used in the analysis, we don't. 

/* 
When the commodity export share is null but there are signs of firm level export because of the dummy and/or the total share, it can be either that: 
- the truly positive share of commodity exported was not reported by the respondent and this ended in a spurious zero.
- null prex reflects reality: there was some firm level export but this commodity was indeed not exported at all.  
 
We trust the former more in imp1 and the latter more in imp2, i.e. we discredit null prex_ variables only in imp1 and not in imp2. 
BUT, some imp2 that remain 0 here will actually be turned to positive values below, when they are in obvious cases of 
being equal to the total share (either because the total share is 100% or because there is only one commo exported, but not when there is another commo exported 
because it is precisely less clear whether the null commodity export share is true or not then).

Also, in imp1, null prex are deemed spurious zeros if both the dummy and total export share are missing.

*** TURN MISSING OR NULL TO POSITIVE ***

/*
we use the already imputed version of export_pct, i.e. export_pct_imp so that imputations on prex_vars account for the prior routine cleaning.
The imputations made on export_pct_imp, from missing to zeros and from zeros to missing, won't affect the following imputations, as they only use positive 
total export shares that were affected by neither of them.  

For CPO, 
Among obs. that have prex_cpo missing and export_pct non missing, we can make increasingly strong imputations:

	1. If the total export share is 100%, all the commodity shares are necessarily 100% too (for those commodities that are produced). 

	2. Suppose you produce only CPO. Then the total export share is equal to the commodity export share. replace prex_cpo_imp1 and prex_cpo_imp2 with export_pct if prex_cpo <. 

	3. If you produce CPO and other commodities - FOR WHICH PREX_ IS KNOWN - we can impute prex_cpo rather precisely (not exactly because other products than those 4 may be exported). 
		There will be a different formula depending on whether the firm produces only one other commo, 2, or 3 other commodities.  
	
	4. If you produce CPO and other commodities - FOR WHICH PREX_ OR NECESSARY INFO IS MISSING (so that we cannot compute prex_cpo) - there are two extreme options: 
		a) we use the firm level export share as a proxy for the commodity level export share, which is the same as assuming that all commodities produced 
			were exported in the same proportions (once weighted with the amounts produced), this is _imp1. 
		b) we are conservative and don't impute more. 
		 
	These options don't depend on whether the firm produces 1, 2, or 3 other commodities. 

1. and 2. make the same modifications to imp1 and imp2. 
3. modifies a subgroup of missing prex when export_pct is not missing. It makes the same imputations on imp1 and on imp2, but this does not affect both equally. 
	This is because it also affects the initially null prex that have first been turned to missing in imp1, but not in imp2 because these may actually mean that the respondents
	knew one thing for sure: that this commodity was not exported, while still exporting an other product.  
4. modifies an other subgroup of missing prex when export_pct is not missing (those that missed some information to enter the imputation in 3.)
Finally: 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN _IMP1 AND _IMP2 IS THAT _IMP2 IS NOT IMPUTED TO BE EQUAL TO THE TOTAL SHARE UNLESS 
IT IS 100; OR THERE IS ONLY ONE COMMODITY; OR IT IS MISSING (AND NOT NULL) AND THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE OTHER EXPORTED COMMODITY.

Then repeat this for PKO.

/* DRAFT NOTES ON THIS SECTION: 
			However, regarding the diversity of cases, this would mean applying a variety of different rationales to annual imputations, making the tractability of 
			those choices too intricate. 
			We rather choose to apply homogeneous data processing over years acknowledge that some structural flaws in available data induce time varying noise.

		Let's just summarize what this section did regarding null prex and null export_pct. 
		- It replaced any missing prex with export_pct when the latter was null, following the argument that a firm may have not informed the prex for each commodity when it is 
		exporting nothing anyway, and just responded 0 for the total export share. 
		- It never replaced prex with export_pct when the former was positive and the latter null, assuming there is no reason for a firm to respond a positive value on a commo line if the export is null, 
		so the error has to come from export_pct... 
		- It never replaced prex with export_pct when the former was null and the latter positive bc it could be positive for other commo but null for one in particular and hence positive on average. 		

		// PRPREX
			g PR = (PRPREX > 0) if !mi(PRPREX)
			tabulate year PR, missing
			/*What one can see is that there are years when there are no missings (and #zeros might be more than the actual instances of null export.) 
			That's 1998-2009 bar the 5 years when full variable is missing. 
			In 2010, 2011, 2012, that's the other way round - no zero and only positive or missing values. 
			If we use these, then it is equivalent in terms of imputation strength: we wuold have to assume that all missings are null exports. 
			*/

		// export_pct

			g ep = (export_pct > 0) if !mi(export_pct)
			tabulate year ep, missing
			/*
			Same: only zeros and no missings (beside positive values). With a small exception in 2015 with 60 missing values. 
			And the 5 years of missing still.
